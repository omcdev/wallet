        OmniCoin Wallet Beta 0.0.1
    </p>
    <p>
        OmniCoin is a P2P payment network specifically designed for mobile payment and mobile device mining purpose. OmniCoin allow all mobile devices participate in together maintaining the blockchain network while leaving it idle and charging the battery, instead of requiring expensive computer hardware running 24/7 to perform the block validation work. The main objective is to create a very least effort way to maintain the blockchain network at the same time promoting the reusability of existing resources especially mobile devices. So that even the non-tech savvy user or normal consumer can easily learn and involve in mining, as long as they at least have a smartphone.
    </p>
    <p>
        In fact, we all know that smartphone or any other mobile devices are not suitable to be setup as a blockchain node. The reasons are the computing power is weak, storage capacity is limited to keep the full blockchain data and the battery powered device are not meant to be 24/7 running all the time, and it requires high network bandwidth to synchronize the blocks data. If a mobile device runs the node using 4G network, it will finish up all the bandwidth in no time.
    </p>
    <p>
        OmniCoin is built using an enhanced version of Proof-of-Capacity consensus algorithm which is Delegate Proof-of-Capacity (DPoC) to achieve the mobile mining capability while keeping the mobile device from being a full node and perform extensive block synchronization work. OmniCoin is developed using an in-house built OmniCoin proprietary customizable blockchain technology - OmniCoin. OmniCoin provide standard blockchain modules with the "plug-and-play" capability for developers to modify the blockchain characteristic base on the business requirement.
